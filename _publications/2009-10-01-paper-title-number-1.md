As avatars have evolved from simple digital representations into extensions of our identities, they offer unprecedented opportunities for self-expression and customization beyond the physical world limitations. While virtual platforms foster new forms of identity exploration, social norms still play a crucial role in defining what is considered appropriate in these environments. In this study, we surveyed 150 participants to investigate social norms surrounding avatar modifications, examining how perspectives, contexts, and personality traits influence attitudes toward appropriateness. Our findings reveal that avatar modifications are generally viewed as more appropriate when considered from a partner's perspective, especially for changeable attributes. However, these modifications are perceived as less acceptable in professional settings such as workplaces. Additionally, individuals with high self-monitoring tendencies tend to be more resistant to changes, while those scoring higher on Machiavellianism are more accepting of changes, particularly regarding unchangeable attributes and emotional expressions. These findings provide valuable insights for platform developers and designers, highlighting the importance of implementing context-aware customization options that balance core identity elements with personality-driven preferences, thereby enhancing user experiences while respecting social norms.
